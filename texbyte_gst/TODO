[x] Handle CESS with GST!
    Configuration:
      1. Create new CESS (non-gst) tax as explained in https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/17974
      2. Make sure to drag down this entry *after* all GST entries using the handle (Accounting > Configuration > Accounting > Taxes)
      3. Step 2 ensures that CESS will be applied only *after* GST. Also, GST group has the flag 'Affect Base of Subsequent Taxes' checked
      4. Add GST and CESS tax to the product (not sure if it can be added via HSN)
    GSTR reports:
      1. Assumptions made: CESS applies and appears in tax_lines after GST taxes
[] GSTR1 & GSTR2: The tax rates and amount are found using tax.compute_all() method -- this actually recalculates the tax instead of taking
    existing tax values on the line. This may affect calculation of tax rate of an item is changed later on and reports are taken afterwards...
    This is also the reason why B2BUR in GSTR2 works (because, due to Reverse Charge we were remove taxes on Vendor Bills from unregistered vendors)
